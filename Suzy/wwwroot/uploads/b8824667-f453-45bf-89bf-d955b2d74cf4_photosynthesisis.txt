Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants use sunlight to synthesize food from carbon dioxide and water. It generally involves the green pigment chlorophyll and generates oxygen as a byproduct.

The process occurs mainly in the leaves, in cell structures called chloroplasts. It consists of two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the Calvin cycle (light-independent reactions).

In the light-dependent reactions, sunlight is absorbed by chlorophyll, leading to the production of ATP and NADPH.

The Calvin cycle then uses ATP and NADPH to convert carbon dioxide into glucose.

Photosynthesis is vital because it provides the oxygen we breathe and is the foundation of the food chain.
