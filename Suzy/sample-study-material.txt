Photosynthesis Study Notes

Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize foods with carbon dioxide and water. 

Key Components:
- Chloroplasts: The organelles where photosynthesis occurs
- Chlorophyll: The green pigment that captures light energy
- Stomata: Tiny pores on leaves that allow gas exchange

The Equation:
6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy â†’ C6H12O6 + 6O2

Two Main Stages:
1. Light-dependent reactions (occur in thylakoids)
   - Capture light energy
   - Split water molecules
   - Produce ATP and NADPH

2. Light-independent reactions (Calvin Cycle - occurs in stroma)
   - Use ATP and NADPH to convert CO2 into glucose
   - Don't require direct sunlight

Factors Affecting Photosynthesis:
- Light intensity
- Carbon dioxide concentration  
- Temperature
- Water availability

Importance:
- Produces oxygen for life on Earth
- Forms the base of most food chains
- Removes carbon dioxide from atmosphere
